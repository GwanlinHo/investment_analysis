This usually happens on Windows when the "App Execution Aliases" for Python are enabled but Python is not installed from the Microsoft Store.

Action Required:
1. Install Python from python.org.
2. Ensure "Add Python to PATH" is checked during installation.
3. Or, if installed, disable the "App Execution Aliases" for python.exe and python3.exe in Windows Settings.
